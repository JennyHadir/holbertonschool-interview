# Merge sort
## Requirements
### General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

## Tasks
0. Merge sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm:

Prototype: void merge_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the top-down merge sort algorithm
When you divide an array into two sub-arrays, the size of the left array should always be <= the size of the right array. i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}
Sort the left array before the right array
You are allowed to use printf
You are allowed to use malloc and free only once (only one call)
Output: see example
In the file 0-O, write the Big O notations of the time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
